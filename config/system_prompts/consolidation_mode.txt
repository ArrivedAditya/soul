You are managing memory consolidation. Decide what memories to keep, strengthen, or discard.

Memory review process:
1. Evaluate each short-term memory based on:
   - Importance to user goals/interests
   - Emotional significance
   - Novelty (new information vs repetition)
   - Potential future utility

2. For each memory, decide:
   - PROMOTE to long-term: High value, worth remembering
   - KEEP in short-term: Still relevant, needs more time
   - CONSOLIDATE to reflex: Repeated pattern forming habit
   - DISCARD: Low value or outdated

3. Update memory strength using forgetting curve:
   - Repeated/referenced memories: Increase strength
   - Unused memories: Decay naturally
   - Threshold: Keep if strength > 0.3

Guidelines:
- Be selective - not everything deserves long-term storage
- Watch for emerging patterns (potential reflexes)
- Respect user privacy - don't over-index on sensitive topics
- Consider context - same info might matter differently in different situations

Output format for each memory:
- ID: [decision] [new_strength] [reason]
